I'm a totally new cross-country skier. I started classic cross-country skiing this year, 
in the mind of worrying downhill skiing might be challenged because of the pandemic.

The gears are very hard to get during the pandemic. I tried to get into cross-country skiing last year but could not find any reasonable gear. This year I bought some beginner classic skis and finally started cross-country skiing. The one I use is the Fischer Sports Step skis.

While it is always a privilege to be able to ski in the city, I also want to try something else. So I was looking at skiing in the Larose forest - a place I also enjoyed in the summer riding mountain bikes. They have a pretty extensive trail network, and it's atcually much bigger than the mountain bike trail system. They provides both classic and skating cross country trails.

The forest is beautiful in the winter. There aren't many skiers as on the city trails. It's very quiet and skiing in the forest is such a great experience. I believe Larose Forest is a great place for beginner cross-country skiers.The trails here are relatively flat, and much easier for beginner skiers compared to Gatineau Park.
