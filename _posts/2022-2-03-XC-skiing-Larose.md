Cross-country skiing is a beloved sport in Canada, particularly in Ottawa. The city boasts the largest Nordic skiing center in North America—the renowned Gatineau Park.
As an enthusiastic downhill skier, I’ve always yearned to experience some thrill of cross-country skiing. I’ve heard that it provides significant cardiovascular fitness benefits.

However, securing the necessary gear during the pandemic presented a challenge. Despite my interest in cross-country skiing last year,
I struggled to find suitable equipment. But this year, I finally took the plunge into classic cross-country skiing. I invested in a beginner’s set of classic skis from the Fischer Sports Step range.

My cross-country skiing journey began with urban skiing near the Rideau River—an excellent starting point for beginners. I must give credit to the [Rideau Winter Trail](https://www.rideauwintertrail.ca/),
as they’ve done an exceptional job maintaining the city trails. However, my adventurous spirit craved a change of scenery. That’s when I discovered the Larose Forest,
a place I had previously explored during summer mountain biking escapades. The forest boasts an extensive trail network, surpassing even the mountain bike system in size.
Here, you’ll find both classic and skating cross-country trails.

Winter transforms the forest into a serene wonderland. Unlike the city trails, the forest trails are less crowded, offering a tranquil skiing experience.
Skiing amidst the quiet beauty of the forest is truly a unique experience. I believe the Larose Forest is an excellent choice for beginner cross-country skiers. The trails here are relatively flat,
making them much more accessible for beginners compared to those in Gatineau Park.
