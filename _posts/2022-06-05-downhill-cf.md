Ever since I took up mountain biking in 2021, I’ve fallen head over heels for this exhilarating sport. Now in my second year of mountain biking,
I’ve explored the trails extensively at both Larose Forest and Gatineau Park. However, my adventurous spirit craves something new.

When my more experienced friend invited fellow riders to explore Camp Fortune, I seized the opportunity to expand my riding network.
Camp Fortune promised a unique experience, but it also posed a formidable challenge for a novice like me.
Renowned for its thrilling downhill trails, Camp Fortune lives up to its reputation. Locals often say, "If you can ride at Fortune, you can ride anywhere else."
And indeed, the Capital region echoes this sentiment.
On its [website](https://campfortune.com/mountain-biking/), it also clearly says: "There is no easy way down."  
As I prepared to ride, I knew I was in for an exhilarating adventure—one that would test my limits and push me beyond my comfort zone.

Knowing our limits, we opted for a gentler start. Our choice: the blue trail named Sunset. After a grueling ascent on CBC, we glided along the Sunset section for a short period of time.
It felt chunkier than my usual rides in Gatineau Park, but I maintained control. Then came Salamander—a blue downhill trail that unleashed wild terrain (we deviated from Sunset and went to the downhill section).
Picture a rapid descent, where elevation dropped dramatically in mere minutes. Riding a downhill trail for the first time was exhilarating;
the rush of going downhill was addictive. Yet, even a blue trail at Camp Fortune proved challenging, especially for a novice like me.
I found myself catching my breath several times during the three-minute descent, my hands still tingling from the ride minutes after the descending.

We are back at the main lodge ready for something different, we decide to try thr brain side of Camp Fortune. Our chosen trail: Social Decline, another blue route. The climb was shorter but technically demanding compared to CBC.
We had to walk our bike for certain section of the climbing trail.
The view on the top is nice, after catching our breath, we start our decending. Social Delcine is the only blue trail on this side, but it's also not easy.
There are several chucky section that I have to walk my bike. And also a rock roll that is above my skill level.

Finishing touring the brain side of trails, well, at least the trails that within our limits. I went on a full lap of Sunset. This time, I rode the entire length, including the Switchback trail at the end.
The undulating terrain provided a delightful mix of ups and downs, reminiscent of skiing between slopes during winter.

My first Camp Fortune expirence left me buzzing with excitement. And now I know it is true that "There is no easy way down." at Camp Fortune.
I will definitely be back once I become a better rider.
