The skiing season had a slow start for us as the pandemic significantly impacted Ottawa. Several local ski hills could only do their best to remain open.
However, with the improvement in the pandemic situation in 2021, my friend and I finally seized the opportunity to go skiing at Mont Tremblant.

We arrived at the ski resort just before 9 am, right as they began operations for the day. By waking up at 6 am and driving for one and a half hours from Ottawa to Mont Tremblant, we were able to enjoy the first fresh tracks of snow.

Despite the chilly -20℃ weather, we were well-prepared. We managed to capture a few impressive videos before the freezing temperatures drained our GoPro battery.

Check out the video below for some excellent carving on a frosty day.

It’s been a while since we’ve skied this intensively. We were quite exhausted by the end of the day, but immensely pleased that we could make the trip.
