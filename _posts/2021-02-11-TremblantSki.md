The pandemic is getting better and my friend and I finally decided to go skiing at Mont Tremblant. 

We arrived the ski resort before 9 am, which is the time they just starting operation. We enjoyed the first track of snow by waking up at 6 am and drive for one and half hours from Ottawa to Mont Tremblant.

It is a cold day with -20â„ƒ. We are well equipped and are able to take a few nice videos before the Go pro battery is freezing to dead. 

Check out the video below. Some nice carving on a cold cold day. 

Have not been skiing this intensively for some while. We both feel quite exhausted after the day, but really happy we can make the trip.
