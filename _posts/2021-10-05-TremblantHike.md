As my degree was nearing completion, my girlfriend and I began planning a series of short trips. Given the ongoing pandemic, we decided to stay relatively close to home.

One such excursion led us to Mont Tremblant, where we embarked on a hiking adventure. I had previously visited Mont Tremblant for a winter skiing trip,
but this was my first experience of the mountain during the warmer months. The difference was striking and the beauty, undeniable. It was October, and the vibrant hues of autumn were just beginning to show.

We chose to tackle the Grand Brule, a red trail known for its length and challenging terrain. It took us about three hours to traverse the trail’s numerous ascents and descents.

The highlight of our journey was an off-trail section near the mountain’s peak. We hiked straight up a rocky terrain, rewarded with a breathtaking view from the ridgeline.
It is a ridgeline feel but the path is wide and safe. I believe this is the area you would pass by in the winter when taking the Le Soleil chair lift.

For our descent, we opted for the shortest path down the mountain, the Grand Prix des Couleurs, rather than the easiest (the green and blue trails). This path, which winds between ski slopes and TGV chair lift poles, is quite steep. At times, we had to zigzag our way down, which put a strain on our knees.

However, the descent offered the most stunning views. As the sun began to set, the entire mountain seemed to be bathed in a beautiful, natural filter. It was a sight to behold.
