I start to plan for some short trips with my girlfriend while finishing up my degree. We don't want to travel too far away with the pandemic still kinds of ongoing.

So one of these short trips is to Mont Tremblant. More specifically, a Hiking trip. 

I visited Mont Tremblant during winter for skiing. But it is the first time I visit the mountain in non-winter-time. It is quite different, and beautiful to be honest. It is October and the autumn colour has started to emerge.

The trail we pick is the Grand Brule (red trail). It is a relatively long trail, with lots of ups and downs. We took about 3 hours walking on this trail. 

The most impressive experience that I had is an off-trail part near reaching the top of the mountain. We took a straight hike up a rock maintain, and the scene is magnificent. It is a ridgeline feel but the path is wide and safe.

We choose the shortest path to come down, not the easiest path (green and blue trail). This Grand Prix des Couleurs travels between ski slope and chair lift poles. It is very steep that sometimes you have to move in Z lines. And the knees definitely feel the pain of it. 

But we saw the most beautiful scenery along the descent. It is near sunset, and the whole mountain is like in a wonderful, nature filter.
