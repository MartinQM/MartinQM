I"É<p>Since I started mountain biking in 2021, I quickly fall in love with it. Itâ€™s been my second year of mountain biking now,
and Iâ€™ve been riding a lot at Larose Forest and Gatinuea Park. I want to expicrence something new.</p>

<p>So when my friend ask people to ride at Camp Fortune who is a more expirenced rider, I decide to take this oppotunity to expend my riding network.
While Camp Fortune is definity something different, it is also a great chanllange for a beginner rider like me.
Camp Fortune is famours for itâ€™s downhill trails. There a saying famous in the Capital region: â€œIf you can ride at Fortune, you can ride anywhere else.â€
On itâ€™s <a href="https://campfortune.com/mountain-biking/">webside</a>, it also clearly says: â€œThere is no easy way down.â€</p>

<p>Knowing our limits, we decide to start with something a bit mild. We decide to ride a blue trail called Sunset. After a brutal climb we did ride on Sunset for a while.
The Sunset section was a lot more chuncky than I would normally ride at Gatinuea park, but it was in control.
But then we shifted to Salamander, a blue downhill trail. It goes quite wild from here. I could describe it only as we went down a lot of elevation in a very short of time.
This is the first time for me to ride a downhill trail, and it feels great. Just keep going down the hill.</p>

<p>But the legend is true, even a blue trail at Camp Fortune is channlaning enough, at least for a begnnier rider like me.</p>
