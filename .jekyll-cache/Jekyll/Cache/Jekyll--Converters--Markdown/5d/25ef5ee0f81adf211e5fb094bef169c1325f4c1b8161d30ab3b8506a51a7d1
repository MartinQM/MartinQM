I"ø<p>Since I started mountain biking in 2021, I quickly fell in love with it. It‚Äôs been my second year of mountain biking now,
and I‚Äôve been riding a lot at Larose Forest and Gatineau Park. I want to experience something new.</p>

<p>So when my friend asked people to ride at Camp Fortune who is a more experienced rider, I decided to take this opportunity to expand my riding network.
While Camp Fortune is definitely something different, it is also a great challenge for a beginner rider like me.
Camp Fortune is famous for its downhill trails. There is a saying famous in the Capital region: ‚ÄúIf you can ride at Fortune, you can ride anywhere else.‚Äù
On its <a href="https://campfortune.com/mountain-biking/">website</a>, it also clearly says: ‚ÄúThere is no easy way down.‚Äù</p>

<p>Knowing our limits, we decided to start with something a bit mild. We decided to ride a blue trail called Sunset. After a brutal climb on CBC, we did ride on Sunset for a while.
The Sunset section was a lot more chunky than I would normally ride at Gatineau Park, but it was under control.
But then we shifted to Salamander, a blue downhill trail. It goes quite wild from here. I could describe it only as we went down a lot of elevation in a very short time.
This is the first time for me to ride a downhill trail. And it feels great to just keep going down the hill.
But the legend is true, even a blue trail at Camp Fortune is challenging enough, at least for a beginner rider like me. I need to rest several time on a 3 min decent. And my hand still feels very numb after the ride.</p>

<p>We climb back to the main lodge after riding slalamander, and we decide to try to ride the full section of Sunset this time.</p>

<p>and went to a ride up only downhill trail section. We decide to trail Social decline.
The climbing was relertivly short, but a lot more technical compared to the climb on CBC. We had to walk our bike for certain section of the climbing trail.
