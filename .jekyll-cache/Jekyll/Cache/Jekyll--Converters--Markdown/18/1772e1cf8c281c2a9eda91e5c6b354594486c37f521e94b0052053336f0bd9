I"Ý<p>We started to plan for some short trips with my girlfriend while finishing up my degree. We donâ€™t want to travel too far away because of the pandemic.</p>

<p>So one of these short trips is to Mont Tremblant. More specifically, a Hiking trip.</p>

<p>I visited Mont Tremblant during winter for skiing. But this is the first time I visit the mountain in non-winter-time. It is quite different, and beautiful. It is October and the autumn colour has started to emerge.</p>

<p>The trail we pick is the Grand Brule (red trail). It is a relatively long trail, with lots of ups and downs. We took about 3 hours walking on this trail.</p>

<p>The most impressive experience that we had is an off-trail part near reaching the top of the mountain. We took a straight hike up on some rocky terrain, and the view is magnificent. It is a ridgeline feel but the path is wide and safe. I believe this is the area you would pass by in the winter when taking the Le Soleil chair lift.</p>

<p>We choose the shortest path going down the mountain, not the easiest path (green and blue trail). This Grand Prix des Couleurs travels between ski slope and chair lift (TGV) poles. It is very steep that sometimes you have to move in Z lines. And the knees definitely feel the pain of it.</p>

<p>But we saw the most beautiful scenery along the descent. It is almost sunset, and the whole mountain is like in a wonderful, nature filter.</p>
