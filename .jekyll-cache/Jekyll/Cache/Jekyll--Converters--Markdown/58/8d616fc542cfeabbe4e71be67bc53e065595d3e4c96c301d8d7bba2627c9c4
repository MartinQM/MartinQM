I"ƒ<p>Since I started mountain biking in 2021, I quickly fall in love with it. Itâ€™s been my second year of mountain biking now,
and Iâ€™ve been riding a lot at Larose Forest and Gatinuea Park. I want to expicrence something new.</p>

<p>So when my friend ask people to ride at camp fortune who is a more expirenced rider, I decide to take this oppotunity to expend my riding network.</p>
