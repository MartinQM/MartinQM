I"Í<p>Iâ€™m a totally new cross-country skier. I started classic cross-country skiing this year, 
in the mind of worrying downhill skiing might be challenged because of the pandemic.</p>

<p>The gears are very hard to get during the pandemic. I tried to get into cross-country skiing last year but could not find any reasonable gear. This year I bought some beginner classic skis and finally started cross-country skiing. The one I use is the Fischer Sports Step skis.</p>

<p>While it is always a privilege to be able to ski in the city, I also want to try something else. So I was looking at skiing in the Larose forest - a place I also enjoyed in the summer riding mountain bikes. They have a pretty extensive trail network, and itâ€™s atcually much bigger than the mountain bike trail system. They provides both classic and skating cross country trails.</p>

<p>The forest is beautiful in the winter. There arenâ€™t many skiers as on the city trails. Itâ€™s very quiet and skiing in the forest is such a great experience. I believe Larose Forest is a great place for beginner cross-country skiers.The trails here are relatively flat, and much easier for beginner skiers compared to Gatineau Park.</p>
