I"<p>The pandemic is getting better and my friend and I finally decided to go skiing at Mont Tremblant.</p>

<p>It is a cold day with -20â„ƒ, we are well equipped and are able to take a few nice videos before the Go pro battery is dead.</p>

<p>Check out the video below. Some nice carving on a cold cold day.</p>

<p>Have not been skiing this intensively for some while. We both feel quite exhausted after the day, but really happy we can make the trip.</p>
