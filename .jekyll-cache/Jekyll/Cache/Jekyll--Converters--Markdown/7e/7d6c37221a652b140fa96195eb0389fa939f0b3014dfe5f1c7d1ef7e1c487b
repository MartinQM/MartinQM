I"<p>Since I started mountain biking in 2021, I quickly fall in love with it. It’s been my second year of mountain biking now,
and I’ve been riding a lot at Larose Forest and Gatinuea Park. I want to expicrence something new.</p>

<p>So when my friend ask people to ride at Camp Fortune who is a more expirenced rider, I decide to take this oppotunity to expend my riding network.
While Camp Fortune is definity something different, it is also a great chanllange for a beginner rider like me.
Camp Fortune is famours for it’s downhill trails. There a saying famous in the Capital region: “If you can ride at Fortune, you can ride anywhere else.”
On it’s <a href="https://campfortune.com/mountain-biking/">webside</a>, it also clearly says: “There is no easy way down.”</p>
